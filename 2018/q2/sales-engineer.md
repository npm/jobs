## about npm

npm is the package manager for all JavaScript, serving code modules to
over 11 million developers around the globe. As a low-friction way to
share code, it has facilitated some of the largest open source
movements in web development. Since its invention in 2009, over
628,000 packages have been published. In 2018, nearly everybody who
builds a website uses npm to help them do it.

We believe that high-performing teams include people from different
backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions
with fresh perspectives. To that end, we actively seek a diverse pool
of applicants, including those from historically marginalized groups —
women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly
incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation
immigrants, and people from low-income families.

## our code of conduct

npm exists to facilitate sharing code, by making it easy for
JavaScript module developers to publish and distribute packages.  npm
is a piece of technology, but more importantly, it is a community.  We
believe that our mission is best served in an environment that is
friendly, safe, and accepting; free from intimidation or harassment.
We do not tolerate abusive behavior.  See our unabridged code of
conduct [here](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/conduct).
