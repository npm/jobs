# Account Executive

npm, Inc. is the company behind npm, used by millions of Javascript developers and 
by companies like Google, PayPal, Uber, Twitter, Dropbox, Tesla, Adobe, 
Amazon, and thousands of others every day to build great web applications faster.

npm is expanding its enterprise-focused offering to give businesses enhanced 
security and control over applications they build using open source components. 
Typical sales opportunities for these products range from $10,000 to over 
$100’s of thousands per year.

## about this role

As an early member of the sales team, you have the opportunity to help build a 
growth machine. You'll not only be prospecting and closing complex enterprise
sales, you will also collaborate with the npm team on customer engagement strategies 
that optimize success for both your customer and npm. We touch many developers, and 
thousands of businesses. This wealth of existing contact points presents a challenge, 
and to be successful, you must be focused and comfortable working in a high-velocity
sales environment.

You should be familiar with software development practices as well as budget
and execution challenges that face your customers who are managers, directors, and VP's
in engineering, product development, information security, and at C-level. You'll use
that understanding to translate the impact of various solutions to help your customer
achieve success.

You should have a disciplined approach to sales, and be an effective user of 
automated sales tools to develop highly personalized and targeted multi-touch 
outreach. Together, we will help shape an organization designed to drive 
deal velocity and equip customers to quickly attain their desired goals.

This role gives you the unique opportunity to deliver new valuable enterprise 
capabilities to customers that already recognize, and love using npm. Working with
a diverse team of talented (and fun) individuals, this is your opening to prosper
while making web application development faster, more productive, and safer for
thousands of businesses and millions of developers.

## about npm

npm is the package manager for all JavaScript, serving code modules to
over 11 million developers around the globe. As a low-friction way to
share code, it has facilitated some of the largest open source
movements in web development. Since its invention in 2009, over
628,000 packages have been published. In 2018, nearly everybody who
builds a website uses npm to help them do it.

We believe that high-performing teams include people from different
backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions
with fresh perspectives. To that end, we actively seek a diverse pool
of applicants, including those from historically marginalized groups —
women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly
incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation
immigrants, and people from low-income families.

## our code of conduct

npm exists to facilitate sharing code, by making it easy for
JavaScript module developers to publish and distribute packages.  npm
is a piece of technology, but more importantly, it is a community.  We
believe that our mission is best served in an environment that is
friendly, safe, and accepting; free from intimidation or harassment.
We do not tolerate abusive behavior.  See our unabridged code of
conduct [here](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/conduct).
