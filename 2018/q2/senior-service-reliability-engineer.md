# Sr. Service Reliability Engineer

### Who we are

npm is the world’s largest software repository, with 11 million users and over 15 software package billion downloads every month. The mesh of micro services and data sources that comprise the npm registry is complex, interesting, and critical to the daily work of millions of JavaScript programmers. Our software and systems are constantly in flux as we adapt to nearly exponential growth. We need you to help us with this never-ending, always-changing task.

### What you'll do

Can you learn quickly? Are you compassionate and productive? Are you self-motivated? — regardless of experience, if you answered yes, this role could be an excellent fit for you. In this role, you will have both the freedom and the responsibility to make a significant impact on our systems. You’ll get the chance to:

  -  contribute to many of npm’s open source projects
  -  work on operations and configuration
  -  improve existing code bases, replacing code with greenfield work
  -  evolve our systems to scale for the load we expect to see next year, not merely the load we’re handling today
  -  investigate problems and discover the right tools to solve them


### What we value

Our services team values analysis, communication, action, sustainability, and reflection. We work collaboratively to find the best solutions to problems. We write constantly about our work, both to improve our own thinking about it and to communicate with one another. We focus on tools and processes that support our work rather than on individual heroics. Because the team is small, we also value flexibility, scrappy problem solving, and continual process improvements. We handle the largest package repository in the world, and take that responsibility seriously. If we don’t fix it, nobody else will. Your work at npm will make every JavaScript developer in the world faster and happier.

### Our code of conduct

npm exists to facilitate sharing code, by making it easy for JavaScript module developers to publish and distribute packages.
npm is a piece of technology, but more importantly, it is a community.
We believe that our mission is best served in an environment that is friendly, safe, and accepting; free from intimidation or harassment. We do not tolerate abusive behavior.

### Why you should join

In joining the npm team, you'll become an important part of a small but dedicated engineering team. We strive to provide a sensible balance between work and non-work, and we allow you to define your own schedule. We also understand that healthy schedules lead to better outcomes. To help ensure this balance we have contracted support night coverage so we don't interrupt anyone's sleep. 

We believe that high-performing teams include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we actively seek a diverse pool of applicants, including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, and people from low-income families.

### Where we can hire

Our headquarters are in Oakland, California. The services team has members in Oakland, Seattle, Portland, Brooklyn, England, and Poznan. If you have experience working remotely, so do we. We cannot currently sponsor new work visas other than TN-1s, but we can transfer existing H-1Bs.
