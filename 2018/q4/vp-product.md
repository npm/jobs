# Vice President of Product

## About npm
Are you interested in joining the company that powers all web
development?  npm is the package manager for JavaScript, the most
important and fastest growing programming language on earth.  Over 11
million developers use npm every day, at every company with a website.
npm, Inc. is the company behind this revolution, developing products
to bring value to enterprises in every vertical.


## Our code of conduct
npm is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate in a professional environment. We do not tolerate harassment in any form and we are committed to partnering with you to foster a healthy work environment.


## About this role
As Vice President of Product, you will facilitate our product
development efforts with effective processes, user-focused insight,
and market research.  You will work closely with npm's inventor,
leading a team of product managers and designers who are passionate
and dedicated to developing the lines of business that provide the
financial backing to keep this movement from slowing down.

Your job touches on technology, design, and business, but the core
role is to refine and communicate npm's product vision.  You know that the perfect can be the
enemy of the good, and that real-world constraints mean we make
trade-offs to ship anything at all.  Your job is to make sure that
the team makes those choices with forethought and wisdom, helping us
take practical steps in the direction of continual forward progress.


## Key responsibilities include:

- Work with product managers, subject matter experts, engineering,
  marketing, sales, support, and npm's ELT to define a
  product roadmap that is both feasible and compelling.
- Provide clear accountability and mentorship for product managers.
- Establish and manage healthy processes for user
  research, market analysis, forecasting, and design.
- Facilitate cross-functional communication and processes.
- Partner closely with the Chief Product Officer to develop the multi-year vision and strategy
  for npm.
- Develop and validate use cases.
  

## You will love this job if:

- You enjoy working with developer tools and/or Open Source
- You care about User Experience
- You enjoy managing timelines and projects across multiple departments


## Why you should join

- Competitive salary
- Meaningful equity
- Working with a supportive and diverse team
- Industry-leading parental leave and PTO policies

In joining the npm team, you'll become an important part of a small
but dedicated product team.  We strive to provide a sensible
balance between work and non-work, and we allow you to define your own
schedule.  We also understand that healthy schedules lead to better
outcomes.

We believe that high-performing teams include people from different
backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions
with fresh perspectives.  To that end, we actively seek a diverse pool
of applicants, including those from historically marginalized groups â€”
women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly
incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation
immigrants, and people from low-income families.


## Where we can hire

Our headquarters are in Oakland, California.  The team has
members in Oakland, Seattle, Portland, Brooklyn, England, Panama,
Poznan, and more.  If you have experience working remotely, so do we.  We cannot
currently sponsor new work visas other than TN-1s, but we can transfer
existing H-1Bs.
