# Vice President of Product

Are you interested in joining the company that powers all web
development?  npm is the package manager for JavaScript, the most
important and fastest growing programming language on earth.  Over 11
million developers use npm every day, at every company with a website.
npm, Inc. is the company behind this revolution, developing products
to bring value to enterprises in every vertical.  It is not an
exaggeration to say that npm has shaped how JavaScript is done.

As Vice President of Product, you will lead our product development
efforts with effective processes, user-focused insight, and market
analysis.  You will work closely with npm's inventor, leading a team
of product managers and designers who are passionate and dedicated to
developing the lines of business that provide the financial backing to
keep this movement from slowing down.

Working with a team of brilliant innovators and pragmatic thinkers,
your role as VP of Product will allow you to make a significant impact
on how software development is done in every corner of the world.

Your job touches on technology, design, and business, but the core
role is to refine and communicate npm's product vision, so that vision
can find expression in reality.  You know that the perfect can be the
enemy of the good, and that real-world constraints mean we make
trade-offs to ship anything at all.  Your job is to make sure that
the team makes those choices with forethought and wisdom, helping us
take practical steps in the direction of continual forward progress.

First and foremost, as Vice President of Product, you bring deep
management expertise and proven methodology to bear on the art and
science of building the right things for the right customers.  We've
managed to build something important; you're going to help us refine
it into a sustainable and profitable business.

## Responsibilities

- Establish and manage scalable and repeatable processes for user
  research, market analysis, forecasting, and design.
- Work with product managers, subject matter experts, engineering,
  marketing, sales, support, and the rest of the ELT to define a
  product roadmap that is both feasible and compelling.
- Provide clear accountability and mentorship for product managers,
  raising the bar for product excellence within the team that reports
  to you.
- Facilitate cross-team communication and processes so that the
  product organization empowers the rest of the company.
- Work with marketing and knowledge management to craft messaging that
  communicates the value propositions of npm's product offerings.
- Close partnership with the CPO on the multi-year vision and strategy
  of npm, aligning on the outcomes we must achieve, and empowering the
  team to define and execute the output, tasks, features, and products
  that deliver the most value to our customers.

## Requirements

We're looking for someone who has done this before.  At least 10 years
experience working in product management is required, with at least
half of that in a managerial role.

Since npm plays such an important role in the Open Source JavaScript
community, experience with technical communities is a must.  A
background in engineering is not required (we've got that covered),
but you must have experience with developer tools and/or Open Source.

You should have direct, deep experience in the following:

- User interviews
- Managing timelines and projects across multiple departments
- Use case development and validation
- Articulating and actualizing a long-term product strategy
- Communicating with executive management teams, engineering teams,
  and partners, with an ability to articulate the right level of
  detail and knowledge to each audience group, both in written and
  verbal form.
- Expert level management skills, building rapport within and between
  teams, providing candid and constructive feedback, and facilitating
  healthy and sustainable working practices.
