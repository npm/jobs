# Support Tech

### Who we are

npm is the world’s largest software repository, with 11 million users. Their use-cases are incredibly diverse: from systems administrators writing automation tools, to hobbyists building robots, to back-end engineers building mobile app APIs, to millions of front-end developers.

Our mission at npm is to reduce developer friction. We do it by building tools that make JavaScript developers' lives easier, by maintaining a registry with fantastic uptime, and by answering the tweets, emails, and posts at npm.community that our users send us every day.

npm has been successful because we care about our users. "npm loves you" is not just marketing; it's a core company value. Users frequently report our responsive and friendly support team as a key reason why they love our products.

### What you'll do

The right people for this job combine empathy and communication skills with a passion for solving technical problems. Experience with Open Source and customer service are beneficial, but not required. Much more critical is a friendly, positive attitude and finding joy in helping people.

You will be the first line of support, fielding common questions, building up FAQs, on-boarding new customers, and solving the unusual or complicated cases yourself, with the help of the support and engineering team.

By directly helping our users and customers, and interacting with every member of the npm team, you'll gain the kind of cross-company insight that is so valuable to a career in technology.

### Our code of conduct

Sometimes, this job is hard, because people frustrated by technical problems are not always polite. You'll be helping to keep the npm community a safe and friendly place, with the technical and emotional support of the entire company, and the gratitude of millions of developers who participate in the npm ecosystem. We believe that our mission is best served in an environment that is friendly, safe, and accepting; free from intimidation or harassment. We do not tolerate abusive behavior. See our unabridged code of conduct [here](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/conduct).

### Why you should join

You'll be a full employee with all benefits, including competitive salary and stock options. We strive to provide a sensible balance between work and non-work. We also understand that healthy balance lead to better outcomes.

We believe that high-performing teams include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we actively seek a diverse pool of applicants, including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, and people from low-income families.

### Where we can hire

Our headquarters are in Oakland, California. The support team is also open to hiring worldwide remote humans. We can best support you if you can overlap with US timezones. We currently have employees located across the US, the UK, and Poland. If you have experience working remotely, so do we. We cannot currently sponsor new work visas other than TN-1s, but we can transfer existing H-1Bs.
