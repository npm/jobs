## About this role

We are looking for a product documentation writer to create useful, usable, and trustworthy help content for beginner to advanced npm users and customers. Your goal will be to empower our users to develop JavaScript applications with the npm CLI, website, and other products as easily and painlessly as possible.

You will be responsible for planning, creating, and maintaining task-based documentation articles, API reference documentation, contextual help content, and other user assistance content as needed.

Include 2 or 3 examples of your documentation work; they do not need to be related to npm.

## Key responsibilities include

- Creating a content plan for documenting new and updated features and products
- Triaging and prioritizing content requests from across the company
- Creating and updating documentation and other user assistance content
- Gathering user and customer feedback from support requests and the npm community forum
- Using metrics to plan documentation improvement projects

## You will love this job if

- You have experience using Jekyll or another static site generator for product documentation
- You are comfortable using Git and GitHub in a documentation workflow

## Why you should join

- Competitive salary
- Working with a supportive and diverse team
- Industry-leading parental leave and PTO policies

In joining the npm team, you'll become an important part of a small
but dedicated knowledge management team.  We strive to provide a sensible
balance between work and non-work, and we allow you to define your own
schedule.  We also understand that healthy schedules lead to better
outcomes.

We believe that high-performing teams include people from different
backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions
with fresh perspectives. To that end, we actively seek a diverse pool
of applicants, including those from historically marginalized groups â€”
women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly
incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation
immigrants, and people from low-income families.

## Where we can hire

Our headquarters are in Oakland, California. The documentation team is hiring
worldwide. We can best support you if you can overlap with US time zones.
If you have experience working remotely, so do we.  We cannot
currently sponsor new work visas other than TN-1s, but we can transfer
existing H-1Bs.
