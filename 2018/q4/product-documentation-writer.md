## About npm

Are you interested in joining the company that powers all web
development?  npm is the package manager for JavaScript, the most
important and fastest growing programming language on earth.  Over 11
million developers use npm every day, at every company with a website.

## Our code of conduct

npm is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate in a professional environment. We do not tolerate harassment in any form and we are committed to partnering with you to foster a healthy work environment.

## About this role

We are looking for a product documentation writer to create useful, usable, and trustworthy help content for beginner to advanced npm users. Your goal will be to empower our users to develop JavaScript applications with the npm website, CLI, and other products and features as easily and painlessly as possible.

This role will report to the Director of Knowledge Management and will not only include updating documentation in response to product ships, but strategic content projects to help us deliver a high-quality overall user experience. You will have opportunities to collaborate with our Product, Engineering, Community, Support, and Marketing teams to refine product interfaces, understand user needs, and develop consistent, compelling messaging across communication channels. We take your expertise seriously and consider knowledge an asset, not an afterthought.

Include 2 or 3 examples of your documentation work; they do not need to be related to npm.

## Key responsibilities include

- Creating a content plan for documenting new and updated features and products
- Triaging and prioritizing content requests from across the company
- Creating and updating documentation articles, API reference documentation, contextual help content, and other user assistance content as needed
- Gathering user and customer feedback from support requests and the npm community forum
- Using metrics to plan documentation improvement projects

## You will love this job if

- You have experience using Jekyll or another static site generator for product documentation
- You are comfortable using Git and GitHub in a documentation workflow
- You are interested in complex information architecture problems

## Why you should join

- Competitive salary
- Working with a supportive and diverse team
- Industry-leading parental leave and PTO policies

In joining the npm team, you'll become an important part of a small
but dedicated knowledge management team.  We strive to provide a sensible
balance between work and non-work, and we allow you to define your own
schedule.  We also understand that healthy schedules lead to better
outcomes.

We believe that high-performing teams include people from different
backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions
with fresh perspectives. To that end, we actively seek a diverse pool
of applicants, including those from historically marginalized groups â€”
women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly
incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation
immigrants, and people from low-income families.

## Where we can hire

Our headquarters are in Oakland, California. The documentation team is hiring
worldwide. We can best support you if you can overlap with US time zones.
If you have experience working remotely, so do we.  We cannot
currently sponsor new work visas other than TN-1s, but we can transfer
existing H-1Bs.
