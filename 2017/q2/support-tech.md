# Support Tech

npm has 7 million users worldwide and that number is growing fast. Their use-cases are incredibly diverse: from systems administrators writing automation tools, to hobbyists building robots, to back-end engineers building mobile app APIs, to millions of front-end developers.

Our mission at npm is to reduce developer friction. We do it by building tools that make JavaScript developers' lives easier, by maintaining a registry with fantastic uptime, and by answering each of the tweets, emails, and GitHub issues that our users send us every day.

npm has been successful because we care about our users. "npm loves you" is not just marketing; it's a core company value. Users frequently report our responsive and friendly support team as a key reason why they love our products.

## is this you?

The right people for this job combine empathy and communication skills with a passion for solving technical problems. Experience with Open Source and customer service are beneficial, but not required. Much more critical is a friendly, positive attitude and finding joy in helping people.

Your job will be to serve as the first line of support, fielding common questions, building up FAQs, on-boarding new customers, and solving the unusual or complicated cases yourself, with the help of every member of the engineering team.

By directly helping our users and customers, and interacting with every member of the team, you'll gain the kind of cross-company insight that is so valuable to a career in technology.

Sometimes, this job is hard, because people frustrated by technical problems are not always polite. You'll be helping to keep the npm community a safe and friendly place, with the technical and emotional support of the entire company, and the gratitude of millions of developers who participate in the npm ecosystem.

You'll be a full employee with all benefits, including competitive salary and stock options.
